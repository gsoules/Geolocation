# Geolocation (plugin for Omeka Classic)

This repository contains a copy of the Omeka [Geolocation plugin](http://omeka.org/codex/Plugins/Geolocation_2.0) version 2.2.4 by Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media.

The Southwest Harbor Public Library modified the plugin to allow archivists to set a location on the map with one click using the item's address and location metadata. It also added a delete option to reset the map to show no pin.
